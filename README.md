1. The exploratory testing report exists in the root of the repository as pdf (exporatory_testing.pdf), and can be viewed directly via GitHub.
2. The test automation solution is a minimal implementation with chai and mocha in JavaScript, just to show the though process and the suggested implementation.

    - An HTML report of the test suite execution can be found under mochawesome-report. This might require cloning of the repo to properly be viewed.
